This directory contains examples of using Spaceport to test various scenarios.

For demonstration purposes, all examples contain only executable specs. You may run `sp code` to generate the code for the examples, like this:

```sh
# Inside the examples directory

cd wiki-search

# Check projects in the workspace
sp list

# Pick a project and generate and run the tests
sp code <project-name>
sp test <project-name>
```
